Login into go into DevOps,
go to your project, create a new repository.

https://dev.azure.com/YourAccount/_git/YourProject

In ML Studio open terminal and do the following:

cd  # to go to the home directory
ls -alF # check that directory .ssh exists
        # if not:  mkdir .ssh

ssh-keygen -C "you@somedomain.com"

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  <ENTER>
    Enter same passphrase again: <ENTER>
    Your identification has been saved in .ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in .ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    ...

chmod 700 .ssh
cd .ssh
chmod 700 id_rsa*

# both files are simple text files.
# the one with ".pub" contains public key, the other one - private key.
# use "cat" command to print the files in the terminal - and copy-paste
# their contents into two text files with extensions "txt" on your desktop.
# also copy the text of the public key - and paste it (add it) to your repository.
# It is described here (step 2):

# At the sam link go to step3: Clone the Git repository with SSH
# Copy the link - it will look something like this

    git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/YourAccount/YourProject/YourProject

# and then in terminal run the following command:

    git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/YourAccount/YourProject/YourProject

# This should create a directory "YourProject" with the .git subdirectory in it
# Now you can move this .git to the proper location,
# Once there run the command to check:

git remote -v

# Then add the .gitignore file, 
# add dot files to make life easier
# then commit and push the files
