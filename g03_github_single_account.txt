Hello Manager,

GitHub doesn't allow a user to have more than one free account.
If you create two accounts (using different emails),
they will eventually detect it, 
and will make both accounts invisible
to others until you resolve the problem.

================================================================
If you have a personal GitHub account, 
and also need to do some consulting
for a business, they can give
you access to their account. 
They either allow you to use your personal 
email, or create a "corporate" email for you.

Either way their account is not yours,
you are only invited and getting access.

You yourself will still own only one "personal" account.

================================================================
Note, it is possible to add second (Company) email
to your existing account.

Finally, it is possible to configure the account
so that GitHub Company-related activity will 
only use Company email.

I understand this is convoluted, 
but this the unfortunate reality.

================================================================
Several months ago my GitHub account was suspended
because I have created additional GitHub account
using a Client's email - to have access to Client's GitHub.

It took me almost a month communicating with 
GitHub to repair this situation and re-enable my GitHub.

================================================================
Note, it was always against GitHub policy
to have more than one "free" account per person.

But in the past it was possible to get away with this.

Recently GitHub is tightening their access policies,
and when they will catch you as having more than one account,
they will disable your access. 

Starting this August 2021 they will enforce two-factor authentication.

So even if you use different computers to access your personal
and work-related GitHub accounts, they will probably still be able
to detect that you are the same person
