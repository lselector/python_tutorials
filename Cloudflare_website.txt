Cloudflare is an American company (in San Francisco, CA)  
that provides CDN (Content Delivery Network) services, 
cloud cybersecurity, DDoS mitigation, 
ICANN-accredited domain registration services.

Think of it as a giant intelligent network spread 
across hundreds of cities around the world.

Cloudflare acts as a security guard, filtering 
malicious traffic and protecting websites 
from DDoS attacks, data breaches, and other online threats. 

It encrypts connections (HTTPS), offers two-factor 
authentication, and provide many other services.

Suppose you want to create a simple static website.
You can use CloudFlare to:

 - Brainstorm the domain name - and register it
 - Set up DNS and redirects
 - Integrate with Google workspace (for gmail)
 - Host a simple static website (up to 25 MB)
   You can upload files to "pages" either from your 
   computer, or from GitHub. Easy.

So CloudFlare is perfect for a short "business card"-like website 
to keep your BIO, resume, and other related files

======================================================
cloudflare.com
login
domain registrtion (if need to register a new domain)
websites - to work with existing domain ( DNS, ... )
Workers & Pages - select "Pages" and create a new "myname"
    it will point to myname.pages.dev
    upload your files (whole directory) - and deploy
    set custom domain (myname.com)
go to website DNS - and add CNAME   www   myname.com
But CNAME doesn't work - so I have to make a redirect rule
   select the website, click on DNS on left,
   then lower on left you will see "Rules"
   Click on "Rules, then on "Redirect Rules"
   Then create a "Redirect Rule" as following:

   rule name: "www-redirect"
   custom filter expression
   when hostname equals www.myname.com
   then
   dynamic  concat("https://myname.com", http.request.uri.path)   301

   deploy
