Use Cloudflare to make a simple static website

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare

Cloudflare is an American company (in San Francisco, CA)  
that provides CDN (Content Delivery Network) services, 
cloud cybersecurity, DDoS mitigation, 
ICANN-accredited domain registration services.

Think of it as a giant intelligent network spread 
across hundreds of cities around the world.

Cloudflare acts as a security guard, filtering 
malicious traffic and protecting websites 
from DDoS attacks, data breaches, and other online threats. 

It encrypts connections (HTTPS), offers two-factor 
authentication, and provide many other services.

Suppose you want to create a simple static website.
You can use CloudFlare to:

 - Brainstorm the domain name - and register it
 - Set up DNS and redirects
 - Integrate with Google workspace (for gmail)
 - Host a simple static website (up to 25 MB)
   You can upload files to "pages" either from your 
   computer, or from GitHub. Easy.

So CloudFlare is perfect for a short "business card"-like website 
to keep your BIO, resume, and other related files

======================================================
cloudflare.com
login
domain registrtion (if need to register a new domain)
websites - to work with existing domain ( DNS, ... )
Workers & Pages - select "Pages" and create a new "myname"
    it will point to myname.pages.dev
    upload your files (whole directory) - and deploy
    set custom domain (myname.com)
go to website DNS - and add CNAME   www   myname.com
But CNAME doesn't work - so I have to make a redirect rule
   select the website, click on DNS on left,
   then lower on left you will see "Rules"
   Click on "Rules, then on "Redirect Rules"
   Then create a "Redirect Rule" as following:

   rule name: "www-redirect"
   custom filter expression
   when hostname equals www.myname.com
   then
   dynamic  concat("https://myname.com", http.request.uri.path)   301

   deploy

Setting Up a Redirect from Your Custom Domain to Zoom

Here's how to set up a redirect from your Cloudflare 
domain to your personal Zoom link:

    Log in to your Cloudflare account at dash.cloudflare.com

    Select your domain from the Cloudflare dashboard

    Verify that two DNS records are set:
    A record - created automatically to point domain to CloudFlare proxy
    CNAME record - to point www.yourdomain.com to yourdomain.com
      TYPE     Name             Content
      A        meetlev.com      104.236.3.83    # created automatically 
      CNAME    www              meetlev.com     # created manually

    Navigate to Rules:
        Click on "Rules" in the left sidebar
        Select "Page Rules" (or in newer interfaces, 
                go to "Rules" then "Redirect Rules")

    Create a new redirect rule:
        Click "Create Page Rule" or "Create Redirect Rule"
        In the URL pattern field, enter your domain pattern to match:
            For redirecting the root domain: yourdomain.com/*
            For a specific subdomain: meetings.yourdomain.com/*

    Set up the redirect:
        Select "Forwarding URL" as the setting (or "Redirect" in newer interfaces)
        Choose "301 Permanent Redirect" or "302 Temporary Redirect" (301 is better for SEO if this is a permanent setup)
        Enter your personal Zoom meeting URL in the destination field:
            Example: https://zoom.us/j/123456789

    Save and Deploy:
        Click "Save and Deploy" or "Deploy" to activate the rule

    Test the redirect by visiting your custom domain in a browser

This setup will redirect anyone who visits your domain 
directly to your personal Zoom meeting link.

======================================================
In my account, I select my domain MeetLev.com.
See the "Rules" on the left, open it, click on Overview.
In the right pane I see one active rule called "redirect to zoom"
When I click on it - I can see/change the details:

Rule Name: redirect to zoom

If incoming requests match:  All incoming requests

Then
URL redirect

Type: Static
URL: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4979450088?pwd=ZmVEMkt4RDMrZW84RVMvYmZDSDI0QT09
