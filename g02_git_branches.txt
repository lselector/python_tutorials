About work-flows which use Git.
How to handle merge conflicts, branching, etc.

Gitlab-ci (continuus integration)

One way to work with branches:
  development is done in multiple dev/feature branches.
  This is convenient when several people work on the
  same feature for weeks/months.
  Once feature is done, it is merged into the "master" branch.
  All conflicts are resolved, the system is tested.
  Then master branch is merged into productin branch
  (master version is taken in case of conflicts).
Note - basically the production release is done by
       using the "git merge" command.

System testing and release to prod is automated/scheduled.

The Admin creates/merges dev branches using GitLab web interface,
because it is convenient, visual, sends emails to the team,
allows to assign to team members, comment, etc.
Another option is to use a unix library git-flow, which is 
basically a wrapper around existing unix git commands.

Here is a description of how the group uses Git:
# --------------------------------------------------------------  
I personally have a fairly simple workflow, and I do most of my 
branching in the gitlab UI. 
... you use "rebase" quite a bit, which I don't.

The simplest case has two branches: production and master
 - master branch deploys to TST, through gitlab-ci
 - production branch deploys to PRD, through gitlab-ci
 - Edits are always made to master; never to production. 
   We use the protected branch feature of gitlab to enforce this.
 - So long as this policy is enforced, you can always do a simple 
   merge from master -> production (ff) using gitlab UI. 
   You will very rarely have a merge conflict.

In general, this policy works very well for the simple case.
 - It assumes that you will be merging into production frequently, 
   so that bug fixes & development can both be implemented 
   in master branch
 - Even then, it gets a little weird when, say, you want to 
   edit the .gitlab-ci .yml file for the production branch.  
   Or, say, config settings which will only apply to the 
   production deployment. You end up editing these in the 
   master branch (where they have no impact) before merging 
   those changes into the production branch
 
This simplest case then evolves into a more complex scenario
when we have a significant feature to develop.  
When this happens, we create a feature-specific branch off of 
master named according to the feature.  This way, bug-fixes 
and other things can be implemented in master before merging 
into production.
Here is what this looks like:
 - master branch deploys to TST, through gitlab-ci
 - production branch deploys to PRD, through gitlab-ci
 - (new) feature branch also deploys to TST using alternate 
   path, through gitlab-ci:
     git checkout b new_feature;
     git add .;
     git commit;
     git push origin new_feature
 - Consistent with the simple scenario, edits are always made
   to master before merging into production. We use the 
   protected branch feature of gitlab to enforce not making
   edits to production directly.
 - Additionally, we make every attempt to merge feature branch
   into master before merging into production. The reason for 
   this is to minimize merge conflicts on the merge into production
 - Bugfixes are typically made to master directly, and in some 
   cases I will merge master into the feature branch to apply 
   those bugfixes to the feature under development. 
   (I could use rebase here, but I don't)
 - So long as these policies are maintained, you can always do
   a simple merge from master -> production (ff) using 
   gitlab UI. You will very rarely have a merge conflict.
 
In general, this policy works very well for the majority of cases.
 - I tend not to delete the feature branches after the merge has completed.
 - I tend not to use tags; for me they are not that helpful
 - We will sometimes get into a scenario where we have several
   feature-specific branches in flight. We continue to adhere 
   to the policy of merging into master before production.
 - Almost all merges are done in the gitlab UI, by creating 
   a merge request. This reinforces an emphasis on the test 
   code deployed by gitlab-ci, since the test status is 
   prominently displayed.
   - This also allows you to assign the merge to someone else 
     in the case where your changes are significant & you 
     would like someone else to review your changes
   - This triggers a notification to the team that new code 
     is being merged in
   - There is room to comment on the contents of a merge

CVCS - Centralized Version Control System (SVN, CVS, etc.)
    Pros: Gold copy maintained in one place
    Cons: single point of failure, confusing merging/branching

CVCS - Distributed Version Control System (Git, Mercurial)
    Pros: redundancy, can work offline - very fast
          branching/merging is good
          developers can pu;l/push between each other
          flexible work flows.
    Cons: confusing because too flexible
    http://blogs.atlassian.com/

git - flexible, light and fast, 
      non-disruptive branching, 
      secure, open source

Gitlab = https://about.gitlab.com - 
pros:
  - dashboard of activity stram
  - web-based repository file browser
  - web based file editor
  - built-in wiki
  - code-review tools
  - graphic diff viewer
  - graphic git history viewer
  - enhanced repository permissions
  - milestone and issue management
  - code snippets
  - web hooks
  - access to git repos over ssh and/or https
  - integrates with Slack and Jira

Gitlab.com vs Github.com

Github - all projects are required to be publicly visible
         (unless you buy a paid version)

Gitlab:
  - you can create private projects on Gitlab.com
  - has protected branches
  - has multiple authentication levels
  - has group level milestones
  - can attach file, issue, comment
  - has work-in-progress protection
  - allows installation on RHEL / CentOS unix
  - has independent packaging - allowing deployment onto 
    a variety of systems

Workflows:
  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows

  Centralized work-flow: one central repo
  
  Integration Manager Work-Flow
    repositories:
        blessed          integration manager - a person who pulls from dev - and pushes into blessed
        dev1pub, dev1priv             
        dev2pub, dev1priv
        etc.
    integration manager - a person/process to copy into blessed repo

  Linux: push-model
     blessed_repo
     dictator_repo
     leutenant_repos
     dev1pub, dev2pub, etc. 

PRH Gitlab - not public, behind firewall
Using Gitlab:
  project == repo
  personal projects - and group projects, 
  group permission levels
  add files
  "star"  (or unstar)
  "fork" (project to a user or a group)
  "download" 
  "global"
  "+" - new issue, merge request, new branch or tag
  issues and milestones (create, assign, comment, close)

ci server controls over servers via "runner" installed on them.

repositories on git.ourdomain.com
runners installed on Build Boxes
build boxes watch for changes, and execute build instructions as needed
build occurs within temporary directory on build box
resulting productionalized code remotely deployed onto destination servers
destination servers run/serve application

This is the prefered architectureL
 - increased security
 - decreased runner maintenance
 - build processing load on dedicated resources
 - promotes "clean deployment " ...on destination servers

# some unix git commands for branches
# --------------------------------------------------------------
git branch         # shows a list of branches, 
                   # current branch is marked
git branch levtest # creates a branch "levtest"
git co levtest     # switch to branch "levtest" (co = checkout)
git co -b levtest2 # create a new branch - and switch to it


vi myfile.txt      # creating file in branch levtest2
git add .
git ci -m'comment'
git push --set-upstream origin levtest2 # next time simply do git push

git co master       # switch to master,   check that no myfile.txt
git co levtest2     # switch to levtest2, check - you see myfile.txt
git ci master       # switch to master again
git merge levtest2  # merge levtest2 into master

git branch -d levtest   # delete branch levtest
git branch -d levtest2  # delete branch levtest2

git branch --merged     # show list of branches which were already
                        # merged into the current branch
git branch --no-merged

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# merging: conflicts resolution
# --------------------------------------------------------------
When merging, you can get a conflict:
git merge mybranch
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in myfile.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

read the man page:
  git merge --help
  man git-merge

Some examples of options to git merge to prevent conflicts:

git merge --ff-only  mybranch
    Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless 
    the current HEAD is already up-to-date 
    or the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward.

git merge -Xours  mybranch
    overwrite using current branch head, ignore everything else

One you have conflicts, git adds standard markers to the files
that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and 
resolve those conflicts. 

Example:

<<<<<<< HEAD:myfile.txt
some text
=======
changed text1
changed text2
>>>>>>> mybranch:index.html

You need to edit the file to resolve those conflicts, 
then commit the result.

Note:
If you don't want to manually resolve these, but just want
to find/review those conflicts, and then to say for the whole
file which version you want, you can do this:

grep -lr '<<<<<<<' .  # recursively get a list of matching files
# resolve one file at a time:
git checkout --ours PATH/FILE    # accept local/our version
git checkout --theirs PATH/FILE  # accept remote/other branch version
# resolve all together:
grep -lr '<<<<<<<' . | xargs git checkout --ours
grep -lr '<<<<<<<' . | xargs git checkout --theirs

Then:
git status
git add myfile
git ci -m'...'
git push

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# merging: conflicts resolution - how to abort the merge
# --------------------------------------------------------------
Thre is no dry-run option.
So to see possible conflicts you do this:
  git status # make sure it is empty 
  git merge somebranch
  # inspect results here
  git merge --abort  # abort the merge
# ----------------------------
    git merge --abort
        git merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge 
        when MERGE_HEAD is present (when merge is in progress).

    git reset --merge

    git reset --hard HEAD^

    git checkout --theirs somefile.txt

    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard origin

    git fetch origin 
    git reset origin 
      (soft reset, your changes are still present)
    git checkout their_file.txt
      (steamroll your own changes back to match the origin)

    git fetch
    git rebase origin

    git fetch
    git log ..@{upstream}
    git diff ..@{upstream}
    git rebase origin

    https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive
       git wrapper
    
    https://github.com/sjl/threesome.vim
       plugin to do merges

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# using vimdiff for manual merging:
# --------------------------------------------------------------
in ~/.gitconfig
    [core]
      pager        = cat
    [diff]
      external = git_diff_wrapper

where ~/bin/git_diff_wrapper is:
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "$1 $2"
    vimdiff -c 'syntax off' "$1" "$2"

# Note - the above wrapper will only work if you 
have only 2 arguments. It breaks if you add options.

Then you can do:
    git diff somefile.txt
    
    git diff branch1:./somepath/file1.txt branch2:./somepath/file2.txt
    git diff branch1  branch2    # diff between the tips of the two branches
    git diff branch1..branch2    # diff between the tips of the two branches
    git diff branch1...branch2   # diff in branch2 between tip and branching point

More diff examples: 
    git diff hash1  hash2
    git diff -r hash1  hash2   # recursive

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# misc git stuff
# --------------------------------------------------------------
git revert   : creates new commit history record and changes code back 
               (this typically is preferred)
git checkout : pulls content from specific commit, does not touch history
git reset    : changes code and potentially erases history ("undo button")

git pull
# inspect - didn't like
git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD  # remove pulled stuff, keep your local changes

git merge --no-ff feature-y  # graphically keep the history of the branch intact.
git log --graph
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
git log -5     # show last 5 commits only
git log -n 5   # show last 5 commits only
git log --abbrev-commit    # show short versions of commit hashes
git log --color
git log --color --abbrev-commit -8 --graph
# --------------------------------------------------------------
git checkout -b feature-y
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "[message]"
git checkout master  # switched back to master
# --------------------------------------------------------------


# --------------------------------------------------------------
Note about rebase operation.
# --------------------------------------------------------------
Admin almost never uses rebase.
But rebase is a good thing.
Here is a link:
  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing#The-Perils-of-Rebasing
The first part of this has some good explanations of why rebasing is good practice.

"""
 ... rebase local changes you’ve made but haven’t shared 
 yet before you push them in order to clean up your story, 
 but never rebase anything you’ve pushed somewhere. 
"""

If you are working on a DEV feature branch while there is a steady stream of
PROD fixes in the main (master) branch, it makes sense to rebase DEV
branch frequently (daily) to apply those PROD fixes to DEV branch.
If this is not done frequently, and if it is a group-owned project,
it means that once the feature DEV branch is done, there might be 
a difficult merge to do at the end because of a long list of accumulated 
production changes, and there is a danger that some wires will get crossed.
For example, people may have forgotten which were the bug fixes 
versus other things that didn’t get kept.
(In other words, a complicated manual merge might be needed.)

On a personal project where others are not contributing, rebasing 
frequently might not make sense.
